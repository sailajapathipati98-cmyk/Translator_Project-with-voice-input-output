# Translator_Project-with-voice-input-output
Voice Translator is a Python-based application that converts spoken words into text, translates them into a selected target language, and plays the translated result as speech. It uses speech recognition and text-to-speech modules to provide real-time voice input and audio output, enabling smooth and interactive language translation.
